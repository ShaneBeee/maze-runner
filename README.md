# Maze Runner

Maze Runner is a console tool for generating, solving and visualizing mazes.

The randomized Kruskal's algorithm is used to generate the maze, and the A* algorithm is used to find the path from the entrance to the exit of the maze. The maze can be saved and loaded in text form.

It is written in pure Java and has a detailed javadoc.

# SkMaze
This fork is reworked to include a Skript addon named SkMaze, which includes several syntaxes to use the maze algorithm in Skript.
